# lambda-twitter-oauth

This is an example of using AWS lambda with twitter oauth ( i.e. for log-in with twitter functionality ).

I based the code and structure off of this example (https://github.com/jasny/oauth-lambda)

Couple notes: 

You need to create a config.json that has your twitter app specific values

You need to edit the gruntfile to point to the lambda method you have created.

Deployment can be done with grunt deploy
